[h1]Cross-Mod Universal Armament Expansion (C-UAE)[/h1]

TL;DR

Semi-Random Enemy Weapons and Enemy Armor with a robust weapon attachment and ammo distribution system that scales with campaign progression. Designed to support other mods.

[h2]To [b]Tactical AI Project[/b] users[/h2]

If you dislike random weapons and want to retain the feeling of vanilla weapon progression, disable that in the mod options. C-UAE will still upgrade enemies' weapons according to Tactical AI logic (enemies will always have access to grenades, a handgun, and a non-handgun main weapon).

[h2]What does it do[/h2]

Increase the variety of [b]Weapons[/b] and [b]Armor[/b] of all enemies you encounter.

The goal of this mod is to be [b]compatible[/b] with other mods out of the box without requiring compatibility patches. Mods like ToG, Rato's Overhaul, or AI mods can be used without issues.

[h2]Features:[/h2]
[list]
    [*][b]Enemies receive new weapons and armor of similar strength[/b]
    [*][b]Weapons and Armor from other mods are automatically added to the pool[/b] (e.g., Tons of Guns or Masters of War)
    [*][b]Robust attachment system. Weapons are granted attachments matching adjusted enemy level. At higher levels, enemies will have more powerful attachments[/b]
    [*][b]Ammunition distribution system. At higher levels, enemies will have increasingly powerful ammunition[/b]
    [*][b]Works with old saves and can be disabled at any point[/b]
    [*][b]Armaments' condition (how damaged they are) matches the original loadout[/b]
    [*][b]Mod uses base game drop chance logic[/b] (Most mods altering drop chance are compatible)
    [*][b]Night grenades (flares, etc.) are only distributed during nighttime and in underground sectors[/b]
    [*][b]Heavy Weapons are distributed based on ammunition type[/b] (RocketMen still shoot rockets; Montar enemies still use mortar-like weapons)
    [*][b]Mod does not affect unique armaments[/b] (e.g., [spoiler]Pierre won't lose his unique machete[/spoiler])
[/list]

[h2]C-UAE vs Random Enemy Weapons[/h2]

[b]C-UAE[/b] distributes all available weapons across all enemy factions, while [b]REW[/b] uses structured distribution with handpicked weapons for specific factions. This means modded weapons not configured for REW won’t be distributed, whereas C-UAE excludes weapons unavailable at Bobby Ray’s.

[b]Configuration options[/b] allow disabling weapon replacement, enabling players to use [b]REW[/b] weapon logic alongside other C-UAE features.

[list]
    [*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3021320057]Rato's Gameplay Balance and Overhaul 3[/url][/b] Note: New weapon logic

[/list]

Note: [b]BCE[/b] alters vanilla weapon prices and is unbalanced for vanilla economies, conflicting with ToG/MoW.

Avoid using all listed mods together. Check individual mod descriptions for compatibility.

[h2]How does it work?[/h2]
When encountering enemies in satellite or tactical view, the mod scans their [b]level[/b], [b]faction[/b], and [b]loadout[/b] to generate a profile. This profile creates new weapons/armor. The mod tracks modified enemies to avoid reprocessing them later.

[h3]Available Armaments Logic[/h3]
C-UAE uses in-game [b]Cost[/b] and Bobby Ray’s [b]CanAppearInShop[/b] property. Only shop-available armaments are distributed (excluding manually integrated mods), filtering out quest/unfinished items from vanilla or mods.

[h3]Weapons[/h3]
New weapons match the original’s type, enemy level, faction, and cost range. Attachments (scopes, silencers) are added based on enemy level.

[h3]Armor[/h3]
Armor follows similar logic, replacing pieces while considering enemy level, faction, and original armor.

[h3]Uniques[/h3]
Unique weapons/armor (e.g., Golden Gun, Shiny and Chrome Helmet) are retained. Only non-unique items are replaced.
