    [*][b]Add Weapon Components[/b] When enabled, weapons are strengthened with attachments. Better attachments are given to higher-level enemies. This also causes the dropped weapons to have attachments.
    [*][b]Replace Armor[/b] When enabled, replace the original enemy armor with new ones.
    [*][b]Extra Grenades Chance[/b] C-UAE allows enemies to get extra grenades. This option modifies the chance an enemy will get extra granades.
    [*][b]Armament Strength Factor[/b] Difficulty adjustment. Negative values cause the cost range to be closer to the cheapest armaments. Positive values make the cost range to be closer to expensive armaments. Note: The original loadout is always within the cost range. Mod uses enemy level as a base in addition to the Armament Strength Factor so it is recommened to keep this option in [-1,1] range.
