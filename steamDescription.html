[h1]Cross-Mod Universal Armament  Expansion (C-UAE)[/h1]

TL;DR

Semi-Random Enemy Weapons and Semi-Random Enemy Armor with Robust weapon attachment and ammo distribution system that scale with campaign progression

[h2]What does it do[/h2]

Increase the variety of [b]Weapons[/b] and [b]Armor[/b] of all enemies you meet.

The goal of this modification is to be [b]compatible[/b] with other modifications out of the box without the requirement of compatibility patches. So mods like ToG, Rato's Overhaul, or AI mods can be used with no issues.

[h2]Featuers:[/h2]

    [*][b]Weapons and Armor from other modifications are automatically added to the pool of available weapons[/b](e.g. Tons of Guns or Masters of War)
    [*][b]Robust attachements system. Weapons are granted attachments matching adjusted enemy level. At higher level, enemies will have more and more powerful attachments[/b]
    [*][b]Ammunition distribution system. At higher level, enemies will have more and more powerful ammunition[/b]
    [*][b]Works with old saves, can be disabled at anypoint[/b]

[/list]

[h2]C-UAE vs Random Enemy Weapons[/h2]

[b]C-UAE[/b] distributes all available weapons among all enemy fractions while [b]REW[/b] provides a more structured distribution where all weapons are picked by hand to be distributed for specific fractions only. This difference leads to multiple consequences. E.g. in REW weapons from mods that don't support REW won't be distributed at all but in C-UAE Weapons that are not configured to be available in Bobby Ray's won't be distributed

[b]Configuration options[/b] allow to disable weapon replacement enabling players to use logic for weapons for [b]REW[/b] and the rest of the features of C-UAE

Don't use all mods from the above lists together. For information on which mods can be used with which related to the particular mod's description

[h2]How does it do[/h2]
Whenever players enter a sector all enemies are scanned and a profile of their [b]level[/b], [b]affiliation[/b], and [b]loadout[/b] is created. This profile then is used to generate new weapons and armor.

[h3]Avaiable Armaments Logic[/h3]
C-UAE is built based on in game system of Cost and Bobby Ray's CanAppearInShop property. So only armaments that can appear in the shop are distributed to enemies.

This way mod automatically filters out all leftover, unfinished, or quest items. Those items can be found in both the Vanilla game as well as in some popular weapon mods.

[h3]Weapons[/h3]
New weapons are generated of the same type. Based on the enemy level, affiliation, and the cost of the original weapon, the mod finds the proper weapon cost range and gives a random weapon from that range.

New weapons are also granted Components/Weapons' Mods (e.g. Scopes or Silencer) based on enemy level.

Additionally, if the original loadout has free spots left and there was no Handgun or Grenade then the enemy might get an extra Handgun or Grenade.

[h3]Armor[/h3]
Armor follows a similar logic to weapons. Based on the enemy level, affiliation, and original armor new one is added.

[h3]Uniques[/h3]
Enemies can't get unique weapons like Golden Gun. But also enemies who wield unique weapons or armor will keep them. For example, enemies with "Shiny and Chrome Helmet" will keep it but their weapon and other armor pieces will get replaced according to the mod logic.

[h2]Configuration options[/h2]
[list]
    [*][b]Replace Weapons[/b] When enabled, replace original enemy weapons with new ones. Allows to use C-UAE along site Random Enemy Weapons mod which provides different way of distributing weapons in Grand Chien.
    [*][b]Replace Armor[/b] When enabled, replace the original enemy armor with new ones.
    [*][b]Extra Handgun[/b] If the original loadout has free spots left and there is no Handgun the enemy will get an extra Handgun.
    [*][b]Extra Grenades Count[/b] If the original loadout has free spots left and there is no Grenade the enemy will get an extra Grenade of this count. Setting it to 0 causes no extra grenades.
    [*][b]Extra Grenades Chance[/b] modifies the chance an enemy will get extra granades.
    [*][b]Armament Strength Factor[/b] difficulty adjustmen. Negative values cause the cost range to be closer to the cheapest armaments. Positive values make the cost range to be closer to expensive armaments. Note: The original loadout is always within the cost range.
    [*][b]Allow Alternative Weapon Type[/b] alternative version of weapon generation. Handguns can randomly be upgraded to SMGs, SMGs to ARs, and ARs to LMG or Sniper Rifles.
