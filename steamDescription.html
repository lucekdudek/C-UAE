[h1]Cross-Mod Universal Armament  Expansion (C-UAE)[/h1]

---------------

[h2]What does it do[/h2]

Increase the variety of [b]Weapons[/b] and [b]Armor[/b] of all enemies you meet.

The goal of this modification is to be [b]compatible[/b] with other modifications out of the box without the requirement of compatibility patches. So mods like ToG, Rato's Gameplay Balance and Overhaul, or Tactical AI can be used with no issues.

[h2]Recommended mods[/h2]
[list]
    [*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3090261695] Masters of War [/url][/b] Note: Random Enemy Weapons is required for Masters of War to load but can be disabled
    [*][b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3023672178] Tons of Guns [/url][/b]

---------------

[h2]How does it do[/h2]
Whenever players enter a sector all enemies are scanned and a profile of their [b]level[/b], [b]affiliation[/b], and [b]loadout[/b] is created. This profile then is used to generate new weapons and armor. Mod uses [b]Cost[/b] property of items to access the items of similar strength.

[h3]Weapons[/h3]
New weapons are generated of the same type. Based on the enemy level, affiliation, and the cost of the original weapon, the mod finds the proper weapon cost range and gives a random weapon from that range.

New weapons are also granted Components/Weapons' Mods (e.g. Scopes or Silencer) based on enemy level and affiliation.

Additionally, if the original loadout has free spots left and there was no Handgun or Grenade then the enemy might get an extra Handgun or Grenade.

[h3]Armor[/h3]
Armor follows a similar logic to weapons. Based on the enemy level, affiliation, and original armor new armor is spawned.

Note: Enemies can't get unique weapons like Golden Gun.

---------------

[h2]Configuration options[/h2]
[list]
    [*][b]Extra Handgun[/b] If the original loadout has free spots left and there is no Handgun the enemy will get an extra Handgun.
    [*][b]Extra Grenades Count[/b] If the original loadout has free spots left and there is no Grenade the enemy will get an extra Grenade of this count. Setting it to 0 causes no extra grenades.
    [*][b]Extra Grenades Chance[/b] modifies the chance an enemy will get extra granades.
    [*][b]Armament Strength Factor[/b] dificulty adjustement. Negative values cause the cost range to be closer to the cheapest armaments. Positive values make the cost range to be closer to expensive armaments. Note: orginal loadout is always within the cost range.
    [*][b]Allow Alternative Weapon Type[/b] alternative version of weapon generation. Handguns can randomly be upgraded to SMGs, SMGs to ARs, and ARs to LMG or Sniper Rifles.

    [*]Does not change enemies with Unique weapons like Pierre
    [*]Can be enabled and disabled at any point
    [*]Works with all saves. Will not change enemies in the middle of a fight.

[h2]Bugs and limitations[/h2]
[list]
    [*]Due to a lack of a better solution, Unique weapons are recognized by their UI image path so mods that reuse those can prevent this mod from buffin an enemy holding that weapon
    [*]The drop chance of grenades is hardcoded to match the original drop chance of 5% therefore drop chance mods won't affect how often grenades are being dropped
    [*]Dose not work with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027443738]New weapons of combinations of the original model[/url] as it was not updated to work with Bobby Ray's update
